# Introduction

The activity data


## Loading the Data
Data is loaded with the "read.csv" command, with the following code:

```{r}
    activity_data <- read.csv('repdata-data-activity/activity.csv')
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
    mean(activity_data$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
