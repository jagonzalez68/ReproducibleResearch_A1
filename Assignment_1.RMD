# Introduction

The activity data


## Loading the Data
Data is loaded with the "read.csv" command. Then, rows with NA's are removed with the following code:

```{r}
    library("dplyr")
    activity_data <- read.csv('repdata-data-activity/activity.csv')
    activity_data <- activity_data[complete.cases(activity_data),]
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
    by_day <- group_by(activity_data, date)
    total_by_day <- summarise(by_day, steps = sum(steps))
    
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
    hist(activity_data$steps, xaxt="n")
    axis(1, at=1:nrow(activity_data), labels=activity_data$date)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
